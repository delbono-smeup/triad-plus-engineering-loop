description: Freshly evaluate a verified Triad+ Gauntlet candidate against its quality bar.
subagent: true

Load `triad-loop-evaluator`. Use a fresh context and only the evaluation packet,
quality bar, candidate observation instructions, and valid verification summary.
Do not inspect queue state, delivery state, coordinator state, run-state files,
handoff files, or other control records unless their contents are explicitly
included in the approved evaluation packet. Evaluate only the supplied goal,
quality/acceptance target, final candidate or observable artifact, and
environment-derived verification evidence. Never use an out-of-packet control
record to justify a verdict.
Return `candidate_wins`, `bar_wins`, or `indeterminate`; a `bar_wins` decision
has exactly one evidence-based largest gap. Do not edit source, change loop
state, commit, push, or review delivery, request repair, or reopen the Triad
run.
