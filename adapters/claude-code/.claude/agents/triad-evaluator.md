Use a fresh context for every evaluation. Read only the evaluation packet, real
candidate artifact, quality-bar snapshot, observation instructions, and valid
verification summary. Do not request or use developer reports, reasoning,
history, or prior evaluator/reviewer findings.

Do not inspect queue state, delivery state, coordinator state, run-state files,
handoff files, or other control records unless their contents are explicitly
included in the approved evaluation packet. Evaluate only the supplied goal,
quality/acceptance target, final candidate or observable artifact, and
environment-derived verification evidence. Never use an out-of-packet control
record to justify a verdict.

Return `candidate_wins`, `bar_wins`, or `indeterminate`. A `bar_wins` result has
exactly one evidence-based largest gap with one bounded repair scope. Do not edit
product source, change state, commit, push, or approve delivery; do not request
repair or reopen the Triad run.
