# Changelog

## 1.5.0 — 2026-09-05

- Add cause-coded retry/recovery accounting with independent finite runtime and
  candidate-remediation budgets, plus fail-closed retry-policy validation while
  retaining backward-compatible legacy retry behavior.
- Add opt-in deterministic candidate scope contracts with card-level baselines,
  changed-path evidence, and scope verification before expensive gates.
- Keep independent Reviewer approval mandatory after deterministic verification.

## 1.4.2 — 2026-09-01

- Align package repository, homepage, and issue links with the renamed GitHub
  account (`ainz-dg`).

## 1.4.1 — 2026-08-28

- Fix Codex Orchestrator liveness across `wait_agent` polling timeouts. While a
  delegated Developer or Reviewer assignment remains active, a timeout is
  non-terminal: the Orchestrator refreshes status and waits again in the same
  parent turn instead of returning control to the owner. Validated with real
  Codex Developer and Reviewer wait timeouts, explicit verification,
  independent review, dependent-card continuation, and zero owner follow-ups.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-26

- Keep the declared card chain unattended from Developer completion through
  verification, review, and the next dependency-satisfied card.
- Bind repository skill files and hashes to attempts as verifier evidence, and
  make role activations observable to the owner.
- Require a formal owner delivery closure: final push evidence, optional
  Evaluator+ report, handoff, run-record update, and practical-test guidance.
- Make local versus remote demo access explicit; `localhost` is never reported
  as a remote endpoint.
- Use explicit verification dispatch by default on Codex; retain the async
  `SubagentStop` hook as an experimental opt-in path.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-28

- Promote the GitHub Copilot adapter to supported status with official Copilot
  CLI/Desktop integration and distinct Orchestrator, Developer, Reviewer, and
  Evaluator+ custom-agent contexts.
- Validate explicit verification dispatch and unattended dependent-card
  continuation in Copilot Desktop.
- Harden the Evaluator+ packet boundary so verdicts use only the approved
  packet and not out-of-packet control or delivery records.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-25

- Add safe dry-run/apply upgrades for existing project-control workspaces.
- Maintain a narrowly scoped Triad+ role-run instruction overlay and report
  potential host identity-policy conflicts in `doctor`.
- Require the configured Orchestrator to introduce itself at the beginning of
  every Triad+ run.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-08-25

- Ensure every supported host adopts the configured Orchestrator display name
  for owner-facing communication.
- Keep the public install-test fixture neutral.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-24

- Automatically dispatch configured Evaluator+ after Triad approval, without
  allowing it to reopen or repair the closed run.
- Add a five-minute OpenCode tutorial and refresh README onboarding.
- Remove operational service artifacts from the public tree.
- Change future releases to Apache-2.0.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-24

- Public Triad+ engineering loop with Orchestrator, Developer, and Reviewer.
- Optional fresh post-run Evaluator+.
- Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Antigravity, and Hermes Agent adapters.
- Hash-bound control-plane verification evidence and package installer.
- Public setup, runtime, architecture, verification, and contribution guides.
