# Configuration

`.triad-plus/team.json` separates stable role IDs from user-facing names and
personas. A schema-version-1 configuration has four role records:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "interaction": { "language": "English", "owner_name": "Owner", "communication_style": "concise" },
  "roles": {
    "orchestrator": { "displayName": "Coordinator", "persona": "calm and precise", "model": null, "reasoning_effort": null },
    "developer": { "displayName": "Builder", "persona": "methodical", "model": null, "reasoning_effort": null },
    "reviewer": { "displayName": "Critic", "persona": "independent", "model": null, "reasoning_effort": null },
    "evaluator": { "displayName": "Evaluator", "persona": "fresh and evidence-led", "model": null, "reasoning_effort": null, "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

`orchestrator`, `developer`, and `reviewer` are the Core roles. `evaluator` is
optional and enabled only when `roles.evaluator.enabled` is `true`. Omitting that
field is backward-compatible and means Evaluator+ is not configured.

When enabled, Evaluator+ is automatically dispatched by the Orchestrator after
Triad reaches Reviewer approval. It receives a fresh post-run packet and cannot
change the closed Triad result. Set `enabled` to `false` to disable this default.

The runtime adapter is selected once per installed control workspace (`--host`).
All roles in that run use that adapter; Triad+ does not orchestrate roles across
different hosts. The team file records role-level models and effort, but an
adapter writes those into host-native profiles only where the selected host
supports that facility. A blank model means the host default. Never put tokens,
API keys, or private deployment data in this file.

## Retry and scope policy

New control workspaces use separate finite budgets for environment recovery and
candidate remediation. Existing workspaces that only declare
`max_rework_attempts_per_item` retain that legacy policy. A card may optionally
bind a versioned JSON scope contract at its first assignment; without one, the
deterministic scope preflight is not configured and independent review remains
the semantic scope check. See [verification.md](verification.md) for the
contract and matching rules.

Cards may also declare `required_gates` as an additive list of trusted
repository gate IDs. Globally required gates are never suppressed; a selected
optional gate becomes required for that card, and an absent or empty list keeps
the legacy gate behavior. Selected IDs are validated before Developer dispatch
and are bound to the assignment; Triad does not attach visual or other
domain-specific meaning to a gate ID.
